# community-question-answering

In this project, we try to answer questions people may have posed to the community by retrieving similar questions from a question bank and returning answers for those questions since they have already been answered.

Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Information retrieval, Question answering

Deep learning solutions for retrieving similar questions from a large Q&A archive for a distance-learning platform.

Uses Siamese neural networks with bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs. Used the Keras package for implementation.

Dataset: Yahoo question answering dataset and a WILP dataset (property of BITS Pilani Hyderabad cannot be disclosed)

The algorithms are labeled by directory and each folder has app.py that has the model. Results are given in text files under each directory.
